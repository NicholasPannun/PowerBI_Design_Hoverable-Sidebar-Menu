Hoverable sidebar menus are a specific kind of sidebar that occupies minimal space on a webpage, initially appearing as small icons. But, upon hovering over them, they expand and reveal their complete content.

To enhance the user experience, the sidebar will have a lock icon at the top, allowing users to easily enable or disable the hoverable feature on the menu.
